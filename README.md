
‚úÖ Step 1: Clone the Repository

The user must first download the project from GitHub.

bash

git clone <your-repo-url>
Replace <your-repo-url> with your actual GitHub repository link.

Example:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voicebot.git

Then, move into the project directory:

bash

cd voicebot

‚úÖ Step 2: Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

To avoid dependency conflicts, it's best to use a virtual environment.

On macOS/Linux:
bash

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows (CMD):

bash

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

‚úÖ Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

This installs all required Python libraries.

‚úÖ Step 4: Install the Package Locally

Since we packaged the bot as an installable Python package, the user needs to install it:

bash

pip install .

This will allow running voicebot as a command.

‚úÖ Step 5: Grant Accessibility Permissions (macOS Users Only)

Since the bot interacts with the screen, users need to enable accessibility permissions.

On macOS:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable permissions for Terminal (or the app running the bot).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the terminal.

‚úÖ Step 6: Run the VoiceBot
Once installed, users can run the bot using:
bash
voicebot
Alternatively, if running from the Python file directly:

bash

python3 -m voicebot.voice_bot
üéâ Done!
Your bot is now ready for use on any computer with just a few commands.



Example Voice Commands:
"Click Save" ‚Üí Clicks the "Save" button
"Scroll down" ‚Üí Scrolls the page down
"Switch tab" ‚Üí Switches to the next tab
"Close window" ‚Üí Closes the active window
"Go back" ‚Üí Navigates back (browser)
"Open new tab" ‚Üí Opens a new browser tab
